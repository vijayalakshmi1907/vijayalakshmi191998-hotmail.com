*SDLC is mainly related to Hardware development        *It is mainly related to software testing

*In SDLC  other phases along with that testing is      *IT only focus on Testing
also included 

*SDLC involves six phases                              *STLC involves five phases

*In SDLC more number of people are required            *In STLC less number of people are required
(developers)                                           (testers)

*In this Development team makes the plans and          *In this STLC testing team makes the plan and Design
design            

*Goal of the SDLC is successfull development of        * goal of STLC is to complete successfull testing of software
 software  

*it helps in developing good quality software          *  It helps in making the software defect free

*SDLC phases are completed before STLC phases          * the STLC phases are performedc after SDLC phases
